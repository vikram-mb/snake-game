# snake-game
Classic snake game implemented in python using turtle module

Use keyboard controls: W, A, S, D to move the snake.
Collect food placed at random points on the screen.
Collision with the screen's corners or with the snake's body results in a game over.
For every food collected, score increments by 1 and snake's body grows longer.
